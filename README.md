# Deploy OAI Services to Kubernetes with Helm 🚀⚙️  

This repository provides a Helm-based setup for deploying **OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting)** services to Kubernetes. It simplifies managing and scaling the open catalog protocol on a Kubernetes cluster.

---

## Features ✨  

- **OAI-PMH Deployment**: Deploy open catalog protocol services with ease.  
- **Helm Charts**: Simplifies Kubernetes resource management.  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for Kubernetes environments.  

---

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- Kubernetes cluster.  
- Helm installed and configured.  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/oai-kubernetes-helm.git  
   cd oai-kubernetes-helm  

2. Add the Helm repository (if needed):  
   helm repo add my-oai-repo https://example.com/helm  

3. Install the OAI-PMH service:  
   helm install oai-service my-oai-repo/oai-chart  

---

## Configuration  

1. Update the `values.yaml` file to configure:  
   - Metadata harvesting parameters.  
   - Service URLs and endpoints.  

2. Apply custom configurations during installation:  
   helm install oai-service my-oai-repo/oai-chart --values custom-values.yaml  

---

## Monitoring  

1. Check running pods:  
   kubectl get pods  

2. View service endpoints:  
   kubectl get services  

3. Monitor logs for debugging:  
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
